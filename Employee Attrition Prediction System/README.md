Developed a machine learning-based employee attrition prediction system using Python and the scikit-learn library. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing data, encoding categorical features using One-Hot Encoding, and standardizing numerical variables to ensure optimal model performance. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify key factors influencing employee turnover, such as job satisfaction, workload, and work-life balance.

The model was implemented using algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, with extensive hyperparameter optimization performed using GridSearchCV. Model evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC were employed to assess predictive performance and address potential class imbalance issues using techniques like SMOTE.

The project provides actionable insights to HR departments, enabling proactive intervention strategies to reduce attrition rates and improve employee retention through data-driven decision-making.

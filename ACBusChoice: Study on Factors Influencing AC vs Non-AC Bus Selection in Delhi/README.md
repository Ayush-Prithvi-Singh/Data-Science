Conducted an empirical study in Delhi to analyze the key factors influencing commuters' choice between AC and non-AC buses. The study incorporated both qualitative and quantitative data, gathering insights from passenger surveys, travel patterns, and environmental factors. Key variables such as fare price, travel time, comfort, climate conditions, and air quality were examined to understand their impact on commuter preferences.

Advanced statistical analysis and data visualization techniques were used to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the selection process. The findings provide valuable insights for transport authorities, enabling them to optimize bus services, improve commuter satisfaction, and make informed decisions regarding the introduction of new routes or the modification of existing ones based on passenger needs and preferences.

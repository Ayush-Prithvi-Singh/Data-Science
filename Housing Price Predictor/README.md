Developed a machine learning model for house price prediction using Python and the scikit-learn library. The project involved extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, leveraging NumPy for numerical computations and Pandas for efficient data manipulation. Key steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to optimize model performance.

The predictive model was trained on historical housing data and implemented using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Model evaluation was conducted using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to ensure accuracy and robustness. Hyperparameter tuning was performed via GridSearchCV to optimize model performance further. The project provides actionable insights for real estate stakeholders, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

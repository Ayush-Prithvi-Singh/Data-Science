This project implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes using patient data from diabetes.csv. It preprocesses the data by scaling features and trains a RandomForestClassifier for prediction. The script loads the dataset, applies necessary transformations, and outputs predictions. Dependencies include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, which can be installed via pip. To run, ensure diabetes.csv is in the same directory and execute the script. Future improvements may include hyperparameter tuning, alternative models, and cross-validation.

Developed an intelligent loan approval prediction system utilizing machine learning algorithms and the scikit-learn library. The project involved preprocessing complex datasets, employing Pandas for data wrangling, and NumPy for high-performance numerical computations. Key preprocessing steps included handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.

The model leverages algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting to predict loan approval likelihood based on applicant attributes such as income, credit history, and employment details. Rigorous model evaluation was conducted using performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and the F1-Score to ensure reliability and fairness. Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV enhanced the predictive capability. The project is designed to streamline loan approval workflows, enabling financial institutions to make data-driven, consistent, and efficient decisions.
